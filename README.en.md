[한국어](README.md)

**A Python client library that pulls Korean corporate fundamentals from DART, KRX and Naver Finance into one schema** — financial statements, valuation ratios, dividends, major shareholders, executives, and stock screening.

Same shape as [kiwoom-client](https://github.com/younghwan91/kiwoom-client) and [krx-news-client](https://github.com/younghwan91/krx-news-client) — no standing server. It hits the upstream source directly, in-process, whenever you call it, and hands back normalized results.

> ⛔ **The KRX collection path is currently blocked (measured 2026-08).**
> KRX put a login in front of the MDCSTAT endpoints, and OTP issuance now returns `LOGOUT` instead of a
> token. The scraper treats that string as a valid OTP and passes it along, so it **returns an empty
> list and raises nothing**. Everything KRX fills — valuation ratios, market cap, sectors — goes quietly
> empty (the top 100 tickers can be backfilled with `NaverScraper`; the DART path is unaffected).
> Code walkthrough: [docs/krx-blocked.md](docs/krx-blocked.md) (Korean).

## Install

```bash
pip install krx-fundamentals-client
```

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from krx_fundamentals_client import DartScraper

async def main():
    scraper = DartScraper(api_key="...")  # free key at https://opendart.fss.or.kr
    try:
        company = await scraper.fetch_company("005930")
        print(company.name, company.ceo)

        financials = await scraper.fetch_financials("005930", year=2025)
        print(financials.revenue, financials.operating_income)
    finally:
        await scraper.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Market-wide ratios plus ranking/screening:

```python
from krx_fundamentals_client import KrxScraper, Market, RankingMetric, rank_stocks, screen_stocks

async def screen():
    scraper = KrxScraper()
    try:
        ratios = await scraper.fetch_investment_ratios(Market.KOSPI)
    finally:
        await scraper.close()

    value_stocks = screen_stocks(ratios, per_max=10, pbr_max=1.0)
    top_by_roe = rank_stocks(ratios, RankingMetric.ROE)
```

More examples in [`examples/`](examples/).

DART keys carry a daily call quota. Once exhausted, every `DartScraper` method
raises `DartQuotaExceededError` — a distinct exception so an orchestrator
rotating multiple keys can tell "no data" apart from "quota exceeded":

```python
from krx_fundamentals_client import DartQuotaExceededError, DartScraper

async def fetch_with_rotation(tickers, keys):
    for key in keys:
        scraper = DartScraper(api_key=key)
        try:
            return [await scraper.fetch_company(t) for t in tickers]
        except DartQuotaExceededError:
            continue
        finally:
            await scraper.close()
    raise RuntimeError("all keys exhausted their daily quota")
```

## Data sources

| Source | Data | Unit of collection | Auth |
|--------|------|---------------------|------|
| [DART OpenAPI](https://opendart.fss.or.kr) | Company profile, financials, dividends, shareholders, executives | Per ticker | API key (free) |
| [KRX Information Data System](http://data.krx.co.kr) | PER, PBR, market cap, sectors | Whole-market bulk CSV | None (⛔ currently blocked by login) |
| [Naver Finance](https://m.stock.naver.com) | Price, PER, PBR, EPS, BPS, dividend yield | Per ticker | None |

## Response models

`Company`, `FinancialStatement`, `InvestmentRatio`, `Dividend`, `Shareholder`, `Executive`, `SectorOverview` — all Pydantic models, importable directly from `krx_fundamentals_client`. See [`models/schemas.py`](src/krx_fundamentals_client/models/schemas.py) for fields.

## Screening / ranking

`screen_stocks` and `rank_stocks` are pure functions with no cache or state — pass them the `list[InvestmentRatio]` you got from `KrxScraper.fetch_investment_ratios()` and they filter/sort it on the spot. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) (Korean) for details.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest                        # tests
uv run ruff check src/ tests/        # lint
uv run ruff format src/ tests/       # format
```
